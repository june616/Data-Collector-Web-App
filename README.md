Build a website with Python and Flask, use a PostgreSQL to store the data, and use Heroku to deploy the application online. 

Once the application gets the email address and height from user, it sends the data to the database and server, then it calculates the average height of all the users that have been submitted data so far, and then it automatically sends the average height and number of people that have submitted data by email to user.
